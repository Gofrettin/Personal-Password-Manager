The Kryloff Personal Password Manager is developed by Sergey Kryloff and licensed you you under the GNU General Public license.
It keeps a collection of your passwords locally in the encrypted form, and allows you to easily enter them into
desired Web pages, applications or documents without using that insecure Windows clipboard.

</font></p>
The general process of entering your passwords looks as follows:
<li>You first, enter your login and password into the Password Manager. This is required only once as Password Manager subsequently stores your passwords (in the encrypyted form).
<li>Then, you open a Web page, an application or a document, and select a desired field to enter the password into.
<li>Finally, you activate Password Manager, double click a cell, after which your password gets entered into the desired field.
<b>The Password Manager window caption indicates into which field the password is about to be entered</b>.
