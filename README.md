# The Kryloff Personal Password Manager

Your Personal Password Manager keeps your passwords to multiple Web sites you visit on the regular basis such as, Internet Banking, Web Mail or Social Networks. When you navigate your browser to any of such sites, you are asked for credentials, e.g. your user, nick or login name and password.

Personal Password Manager allows you to easily type your credentials into the browser avoiding any usage of that unreliable Windows Clipboard: this prevents your passwords, personal and sensible information from being captured by malicious applications. The credentials are stored in the encrypted form and protected with a super-password which is known solely to you.

Of course, such handy features as automatic reliable password generation, sorting of, navigating to Web sites, searching within the Personal Manager records are also provided for your convenience.
