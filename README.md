# Personal-Password-Manager

Your Personal Password Manager keeps your passwords to multiple Web sites you visit on the regular basis such as, Internet Banking, Web Mail, and Social Networks. When you navigate your browser to any of such sites, it asks for your credentials, e.g. your user, nick or login name and password.

Personal Password Manager allows you to easily type your credentials into the browser avoiding any usage of that unreliable Windows Clipboard: this does not allow any malicious application to capture your passwords, personal and sensible information. The credentials are stored in the encrypted form and protected with a super-password which is known solely to you.

Of course, such handy features as sorting, navigating to Web sites, finding records within the Personal Manager records are also provided for your convenience.

The application is written by Sergey Kryloff under the Delphi Community Edition environment which is available for free downloads and usage at the Embarcadero Web site https://www.embarcadero.com . It is provided to you under the GNU General Public License.
